# Aniso-GNN
 
## Setup
Install dependencies. Please check these links to install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and [PyTorchGeometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html).
```bash
conda create --name Aniso python=3.9
conda activate Aniso
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dream3D scripts
run_equi.py: generate 25 MVEs as dream3d files based on equiaxed.json for each texture.
run_equi.m: create orientation data (in euler angles) as txt files based on ODF data of each texture.
yaml_gen.py: generate material.yaml for DAMASK analysis and create orientation data (in quaternions).
grain_ids.m: generate grain ids as numpy array.
C_tensor.m: create elasticity stiffness tensor and save 21 elements in txt files.
S_tensor.m: create Schmid tensor and save 108 elements in txt files.

## DAMASK scripts
tensionX_Al.yaml: loading file for Al, including 3 increments, elasticity deformation at the 2nd increment, yield point at the 3rd increment.
tensionX_Ni.yaml: loading file for Ni, including 2 increments, elasticity deformation at the 2nd increment.
post_processing.py: analyze DAMASK output hdf5 files and collect Young's modulus from the 2nd increment and yield strength from the 3rd increment

## HDF5 Files
Grain IDs, euler angles for each grain and the mechanical property of MVEs are stored in Ni_raw_data.hdf5 and Al_raw_data.hdf5. 

First layer: 12 textures, including
  Uniaxial Compression (0/45/90 degrees rotations),
  Uniaxial Tension (0/45/90 degrees rotations),
  Plane Strain Compression (0/45/90 degrees rotations),
  Simple Shear (0/45/90 degrees rotations);

Second layer: 25 MVEs per texture and arrays storing E_modulus and yield_strength of MVEs; 

Third layer: Grain IDs, euler angles, quaternions, C-tensor, S-tensor of each grain from each MVE. 

## Create Graphs
Microstructure graphs for all 300 MVEs have already been created in the graphs folder. The method to create those graph files (this process may take long time ~20h on regular CPU, multi-processing is recommended):
```bash
python create_graphs.py
```

## Prepare Data
PyTorch datalists for graphs and MVE mechanical properties have been created as pickle files and saved in graph_data folder. The method to create those pickle files:
```bash
python write_data.py
```

## Run Model
The different cases presented in the original paper are:
  1. O-SAGE_Ni_E
  2. C-Aniso_Ni_E
  3. O-SAGE_Al_E
  4. C-Aniso_Al_E
  5. O-SAGE_Al_YS
  6. S-Aniso_Al_YS
  
For each case, four evaluations are performed and loss histories, parity plots, and model checkpoints are outputted.
Four evaluations:
  1. test_45_90_deg
  2. test_45_deg
  3. test_ran_30%
  4. test_90_deg

```
Usage: python model.py [OPTIONS]
Options:
  --cases INT                  Case number (e.g., 1 - 6, default: 1)
  --config INT                 Hyper-parameter configuration number (default: 0)
  --output_type STR            Type of output figures (png/svg, default: png)
```
